PyCaret & Streamlit App Capstone
1. Introduction This web app is designed to provide an interactive interface for data analysis and machine learning model building using PyCaret and Streamlit. It allows users to upload their own datasets, handle missing values, and compare different machine learning models.

2. place the pathfile in streamlit to create an app.

3.1 Launch the app, and wait for the data to be loaded.

3.2 Uploading Data On the sidebar, you’ll find an option to upload your CSV file. Click on “Browse files” and select your file.

3.3 Viewing Data Once the file is uploaded, the app will display the first few rows of your data, its shape, column names, data types, and summary statistics.

3.4 Selecting Target Column In the sidebar, select the target column for your machine learning model from the dropdown menu.

3.5 Handling Missing Values The app automatically handles missing values in your data. For categorical columns, it fills missing values with the mode and encodes the categories using LabelEncoder. For numerical columns, it fills missing values with the mean.

3.6 Model Building After preprocessing, the app uses PyCaret to set up and compare different machine learning models. If the target column is numeric, it sets up a regression task. Otherwise, it sets up a classification task. The app then compares different models and selects the best one based on the default metric (R2 for regression, Accuracy for classification).

4. Conclusion This web app provides a user-friendly interface for data analysis and machine learning. It automates many of the tedious parts of a data science workflow, allowing you to focus on interpreting the results.
